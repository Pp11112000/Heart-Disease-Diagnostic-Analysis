### Project Introduction: 📀

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time, and we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyse this health and medical data for better future preparation. 

Heart Disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems, and it has become major concern in India to deal with as there is around 34.3% increase seen in number of deaths due to cardiovascular problems from 2.26 million in 1990 to 4.77 million in 2020.

Thus, it has become necessary to take precautionary measures to prevent and reduce the heart diseases among people. Therefore, to make sure that the people live healthy lives, the needed research and the prevention process of heart disease can be improved by using good data driven systems for understanding the patterns.

### Problem Statement: ❓ 

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to do the research, analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation. 

### Business Objectives: 🎯

	Performing EDA through Python and find insights.

	Extract various information such as heart disease rates, Heart disease by - gender, by age.

	Compare attributes of the dataset to extract necessary information.

	Make Dashboard with extracted information from data.

	Find key metrics and factors and show relationship between attributes.

### Conclusion: 💡

 45.87% People suffering from heart disease.

 Elderly Aged Men are more (50 to 60 Years) and Females are more in (55 to 65) Years Category.

 Males are more prone to heart disease.

 Elderly Aged People are more prone to heart disease.

 People having asymptomatic chest pain have a higher chance of heart disease.

 High number of cholesterol level in people having heart disease.

 Blood Pressure increases between age of 50 to 60 and somehow continue till 70.

 Cholesterol and maximum heart rate Increasing in the age group of 50 to 60.
